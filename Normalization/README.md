# Normalization

- 1NF (1st NormalForm) --> remove Repeating Groups

- 2NF (2nd NormalForm) --> remove Fnctional Dependancy==>(2NF must be in 1NF.)

- 3NF (3rd NormalForm) --> remove Transitive Partial Dependancy==>(3NF must be in 2NF.)

- BCNF (Boyce Codd NormalForm) --> in every Functional Dependancy where 'X -> Y'; X must be Super Key==>(BCNF must be in 3NF.)

- 4NF (4th NormalForm) --> remove Multivalued Dependancy==>(4NF must be in 3NF.)

- 5NF (4th NormalForm) --> remove Join Dependancy==>(5NF must be in 4NF.)
